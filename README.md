- 👋 Hi, I’m @arehaksqsp -- I started out learning C++ and Java, moved on to C# and .NET, then decided I disliked development and moved away from it. Python brought me back.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Building up skills in Go and learning how to use Rust. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I've just started looking at Go seriously and am fidling with Rust, when & where I find time. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... something new that best mixes all my various skillsets  
- 📫 How to reach me ...
